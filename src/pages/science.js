          <h1>Pedro's story</h1>
          <p>
          Pedro Bergamo is a musician, graphic designer, programmer and marketing especialist based in Helsinki-Finland.
          Born in 1989, he was raised by his mom and step-dad in a poor neighbourhood of Franca-Brazil. He is biological son of Pedro Bergamo from the Sertanejo duo <a
        className="text_link" href={canario_passarinho} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
        "Can√°rio e Passarinho"</a>.
          When young, he was deeply involved with the church and even studied to become a pastor, due to his interest in spirituality, mythology and ancient history.
          He was also passionate about astronomy which led him to the work of Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov.
          </p>
          <p>
          When he was 17, his uncle convinced him to study chemistry, after noticing his interest in Asimov who was a chemist himself.
          In the third year of his studies, he
          got an internship in the department of
          computational chemistry of the University of Franca, receiving a grant to do a Master's Degree and publishing his research in the <a className="text_link" href={chemistry}
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Journal of Luminescence"</a>, besides contributing with his colleagues research published in <a className="text_link" href={chemicalphysics}
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Chemical Physics"</a>, <a className="text_link" href={chemistryc}
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Journal of Physical Chemistry C"</a> and <a className="text_link" href={natural}
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Natural Products Communications"</a>.
          In this period, while still working as a producer and marketing specilist in his father's radio show, he taught chemistry for one year,
          before moving to Finland to pursue a PhD in 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
          In Finland, he got a position as a researcher in modelling and simulation, programming the
          chemistry behind the simulators used in the training of process operators. He is the main author of a review on thoses types of simulations published in
           <a className="text_link" href={minerals}
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Minerals Engineering"</a>.
          After two years as a programmer and teacher, he felt the need to go back to marketing and front-end development, so he
          moved to Helsinki to work at the "Digital Solutions" team of now Metso-Outotec, focusing on
          graphic design, front-end development, UX design, 3d modelling and game development.
          In this site you can find some samples of his work in
          Graphic design: <Link className= "text_link" target="_blank" to="/music">graphic design</Link> and <a className="text_link" href={fs}
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UX, game development</a>.
